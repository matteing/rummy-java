# rummy-java
This is my project submission for CCOM4029. The Rummy game is implemented as a command-line program.

## Deviations from original implementation
I reimplemented the game utilizing the provided interfaces, but discarded the GUI. The project rubric never stated the GUI as a requirement: instead, it was optional.
