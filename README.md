# rummy-java
This is my project submission for CCOM4029. The Rummy game is implemented as a command-line program.

## Playing
The game is implemented as a command-line interface. To play, just run via a terminal. Two player mode is default, and on each turns, players will alternate on the interface.

On each turn, players can look at their hand and the stack. They can withdraw from the deck or stack, then discard. If a set (three or more cards of the same rank) is found, the game will ask the user whether to lay the set or not.

## Deviations from original implementation
I implemented the game utilizing the provided interfaces, but discarded the GUI. The project rubric never stated the GUI as a requirement: instead, it was optional.

## Extra credit
I did modify the game to start the stack with a card from the deck.

## Credits
No external help was utilized for the project, aside from the Rummy rules laid out in the specification.
