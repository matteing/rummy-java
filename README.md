# rummy-java
This is my project submission for CCOM4029. The Rummy game is implemented as a command-line program.

## Deviations from original implementation
I implemented the game utilizing the provided interfaces, but discarded the GUI. The project rubric never stated the GUI as a requirement: instead, it was optional.

## Extra credit
I did modify the game to start the stack with a card from the deck.

## Credits
No external help was utilized for the project, aside from the Rummy rules laid out in the specification.
